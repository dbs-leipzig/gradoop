/**
 * Provides an implementation for the join operand in different possible ways. A join is a binary
 * operand arbitrarly combining the two operands by using different semantics for both the
 * vertices and the edges.
 *
 * This subpackage provides the join with joins definition, that is the formal definition with
 * some enhancements (hashing function). Plus, it implements the R-join definition.
