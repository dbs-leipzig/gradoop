/**
 * Fusion is a binary operator taking two graphs: a search graph (first parameter) and a
 * pattern graph (second parameter) [This means that this is not a symmetric operator
 * (F(a,b) != F(b,a))]. The general idea of this operator is that everything that appears
 * in the pattern graph is fused into a single vertex into the search graph. A new logical graph
 * is returned.
 *
 * 1) If any search graph is empty, an empty result will always be returned
 * 2) If a pattern graph is empty, then the search graph will always be returned
 * 3) The vertices of the pattern graph appearing in the first parameter are replaced by a
 *    new vertex. The old edges of the search graph are updated in the final result so that
 *    each vertex, either pointing to a to-be-fused vertex or starting from a to-be-fused vertex,
 *    are respectively updated as either pointing or starting from the fused vertex.
 * 4) Pattern graph's edges are also taken into account: any edge between to-be-fused vertices
 *    appearing in the search graph that are not expressed in the pattern graph are
 *    rendered as hooks over the fused vertex
