/**
 * Represents an EPGM graph element (vertex/edge) and its query candidates. The
 * query candidates are represented by a bit vector. The value for each index
 * in the vector indicates if the element may represent the query element
 * with the same index.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * query graph: (0:A)-[0:a]->(1:B)
 * data graph:  (0:A)-[0:a]->(1:B)-[1:b]->(2:A)
 *
 * Vertices:
 *
 * bit vector size is 2 as there are 2 query vertices
 *
 * IdWithCandidates(0): (0,[true, false])
 * IdWithCandidates(1): (1,[false, true])
 * IdWithCandidates(2): (1,[true, false])
 *
 * Edges:
 *
 * bit vector size is 1 as there is 1 query edge
 *
 * IdWithCandidates(0): (0, [true])
 * IdWithCandidates(1): (1, [false])
 *
 * f0: element id
 * f1: query candidates
