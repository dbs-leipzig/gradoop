  /**
   * Runs the program on the example data graph.
   *
   * The example provides an overview of the usage of the
   * {@link org.gradoop.temporal.model.impl.operators.diff.Diff} method with pre-defined predicate
   * functions suitable for temporal analysis.
   *
   * Documentation for all available predicate functions as well as a detailed description of the
   * diff method can be found in the projects wiki.
   *
   * Using the bike graph in the {@link TemporalCitiBikeGraph} class, the program will:
   * <ol>
   *   <li>compare two snapshots of the temporal graph</li>
   *   <li>verifies the graph by removing dangling edges</li>
   * </ol>
   * The result is a graph composed by the union of both snapshots where each element is annotated with an
   * additional property. The value of that property indicates an addition (1), a deletion (-1) or a
   * persistence (0) of the element.
   *
   * @param args Command line arguments (unused).
   *
